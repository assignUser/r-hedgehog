## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed "Modern" from the package description

* Referred to the package as a package, instead of a library

* Ironically, I have added more tests.

In addition, the following changes were made for a previous
resubmission.

* Changed the title to not include "for R" and to be more informative.
  I have also extended it to be more informative.

* Quoted 'QuickCheck', as requested, and added a context for the
  term "property-based testing"

# Notes

"Hedgehog will eat all your bugs" is a slogan for the hedgehog projects, hence its inclusion in the description
